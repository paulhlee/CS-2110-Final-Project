# CS-2110-Final-Project

This is the final project for CS 2110.

We have received a distress call from a spaceship (the USS Java) that just crash-landed on an unknown planet somewhere in space, on Planet X. Fleet Admirals Birrell, Gries, and Sampson have dispatched you,as Captain of our fastest spaceship, to rendezvous with the ship and provide assistance. You will explore this uncharted region of space and return to Earth. Something suggests this may not be as trivial as it sounds. . .
